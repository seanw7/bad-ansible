# Bad ansible! This playbook is an example of poor/bad practices!
# Bad practices may include:
#
#   Poor formatting and structure
#   Poor use of YAML - but good enough to parse
#   Inconsistent style
#   Incorrect use of modules
#   Poor module choice
#   Unclear names
#   Hard coding / poor use of variables
#   Roles - what are roles?
#   Bare variables
#   No use of handlers

- name: configuration
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true # remove later! speeds up testing
  become: true

# Need conditionals in order to run these on specifc groups
# while importing roles and running against hosts: all
#   roles:
#     - yum_config
#     - haproxy_install
#     - tomcat_install
#     - postgres_install
